# Neurodata Without Borders
Scripts and metadata for converting Plexon and other data files into [NWB](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) files.

It also contains some README instructions for how to run this stuff.

This is a work in progress!

Possible this is one working example on Ben's laptop.
```
cd nwb
python python/plexon_kilosort_phy_nwb.py -e adpodr -s MrM -i MM_2022_11_28C_V-ProRec --data-dir /home/ninjaben/Desktop/codin/gold-lab/plexon_data
```
